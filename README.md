This is a pong game I created with help of the tutorial that can be found here: 
http://nintendoage.com/pub/faq/NA/index.html?load=nerdy_nights_out.html

I referenced the tutorial for things such as setting up for running on NES emulator and variables.
I've marked the sections that I did not create (mostly at the start of the file and end of the file), rest was done without referencing
the tutorial files.
